## Assumptions based on the ER/UML Diagram:

1. **User Entity**:
   - Each `User` has a unique `userID`.
   - Every `User` has a `username`, `password`, and `email`.
   - A single `User` can have multiple emotions recorded in the `EMOmeter`, share multiple `Feelings`, and write multiple `Comments`.

2. **Feeling Entity**:
   - Each `Feeling` has a unique `feelingID`.
   - Every `Feeling` has associated content and a `feelingDate`.
   - A `Feeling` is specifically related to one `Location` and one `Emotion`, but can be shared or resonated with by multiple users.

3. **EMOmeter Entity**:
   - Each `EMOmeter` entry has a unique `EMOID` and is associated with a specific date (`EMODate`).
   - An `EMOmeter` entry has an `EMOValue` which probably indicates the emotional value or intensity.

4. **Location Entity**:
   - Every `Location` has a unique `locationID`.
   - A `Location` can be defined by `nation`, `province`, and `city`.
   - Multiple `Feelings` can originate from or be associated with the same `Location`.

5. **Emotion Entity**:
   - Each `Emotion` has a unique `emotionID` and associated content.
   - A single `Emotion` type can be included in multiple `Feelings`.

6. **Comment Entity**:
   - Each `Comment` has a unique `commentID`.
   - Every `Comment` has content and an associated `commentDate`.
   - A `Comment` is linked to a specific `User` and a specific `Feeling`.

7. **Shares and Resonates Relationships**:
   - A `User` can share or resonate with multiple `Feelings`, but each shared or resonated `Feeling` is distinct for a `User`.
   
8. **One-to-One Relationships**:
   - The relationships between `Feeling` and `Location`, `Feeling` and `Emotion`, and `Comment` and `Feeling` are all one-to-one, meaning a specific instance of one entity relates to only one instance of the other.

9. **No Multi-valued Attributes**:
   - From the diagram, there don't appear to be any multi-valued attributes; all attributes are single-valued.

10. **No Explicitly Shown Weak Entities**:
   - There are no entities that are shown as being existence-dependent on another entity (typically depicted by a double rectangle).

11. **No Inheritance or Specialization**:
   - The diagram does not depict any inheritance or specialization relationships among the entities.

12. **Implicit Functional Dependencies**:
   - Attributes like `feelingDate` in the `Feeling` entity are likely functionally dependent on the `feelingID`.

## Relationship Cardinalities based on the ER/UML Diagram:

1. **User to EMOmeter**:
   - A `User` can have zero to many `EMOmeter` records.
   - Each `EMOmeter` record belongs to one `User`.

2. **User to Feeling (Shares)**:
   - A `User` can share zero to many `Feelings`.
   - Each shared `Feeling` is associated with one `User`.

3. **User to Feeling (Resonates)**:
   - A `User` can resonate with zero to many `Feelings`.
   - Each resonated `Feeling` can be associated with multiple users.

4. **User to Comment**:
   - A `User` can write zero to many `Comments`.
   - Each `Comment` is written by one `User`.

5. **Feeling to Comment**:
   - A `Feeling` can have zero to many associated `Comments`.
   - Each `Comment` is associated with one `Feeling`.

6. **Feeling to Location**:
   - Each `Feeling` is associated with one `Location`.
   - A `Location` can be associated with zero to many `Feelings`.

7. **Feeling to Emotion**:
   - Each `Feeling` includes one `Emotion`.
   - An `Emotion` can be included in zero to many `Feelings`.
